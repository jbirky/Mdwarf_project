\begin{abstract}
\thecannon\ is a flexible, data-driven spectral modeling and parameter inference framework, demonstrated on high-resolution, near-infrared \apogee\ spectra of giant stars to estimate stellar labels (\teff, logg, [Fe/H], and detailed abundances) to precisions higher than the \apogee\ survey model-grid pipelines.
The lack of reliable stellar models in the near infrared for temperatures $<3500$\,K motivates the extension of this approach to M-dwarf stars, but with new training labels from optical surveys that overlap \sdssiv\ \apogee.
Using a training sample of 87 M dwarfs in the temperature range $2859 < T_{\rm eff} < 4131$\,K, and metallicty range $-0.48 < \mathrm{[Fe/H]}< 0.49$\,dex, we train a two-parameter model with predictive accuracy (in cross-validation) to 77\,K and 0.09\,dex respectively.
These are parameter-space precision statements, but the model is accurate in the data space: It accurately predicts \apogee\ spectral pixels at the percent level.
We also train a one-dimensional spectral type model using 51 M dwarfs with known spectral types ranging from M0 to M9, and demonstrate that \thecannon\ acting on \apogee\ spectra can infer spectral types with predictive accuracy of 0.9 types.
The trained models are employed to determine spectral subtypes, temperatures and metallicities for 10,311 M dwarfs in \apogee, selected in part on \gaia\ photometry and astrometry.
We validate our results using photometric temperature indicators and the \gaia\ color--magnitude diagram.
As a side result, we determine empirical relationships between spectral type and temperature and metallicity.
These results have implications for the NASA \tess\ Mission and other projects that involve large samples of M dwarfs. 

\color{gcolor}{HOGG: just a reflection, I think the scope of this paper has shifted a lot from just being a technical paper about \thecannon\ working on M dwarfs, to drifting more towards M dwarf science (partly because I've learned a lot more about the properties/characteristics of M dwarfs, and the Gaia has given us a lot of intuition that we didn't have before). Anyways we should decide whether the paper is more of the former or the latter and maybe re-write the abstract. Right now it just feels a bit hacked-together, since this is basically just my AAS abstract that we kept adding some sentences to as we went, and I think it needs a better frame. I'm still trying to get a sense of what is scientifically interesting about this sample, and I've been struggling to pin point what the real relevance of this work is: it's not exactly just that the Cannon is precise for M dwarfs (this original scope, like an extension of Ness, is too boring I think, given what we've learned), and it's not really about M dwarf physics or why we are better than models (this is too beyond us to argue). 

I think maybe the biggest angle is that are illustrating what can be leveraged out of two very high quality datasets (\apogee\ and \gaia), and we are the first to identify and collect a large (atmospheric parameters, 6D phase space) that have in the past been very difficult to measure. Is this what we want to emphasize? 

Also an open question along these lines is whether we want to estimate any additional physical parameters for our sample, for example maybe adding radii (from the \citealt{Mann:2015} \teff-radius or $M_K$-radius relations), or masses from his $M_K$-mass relation he's publishing, or maybe there are some other fundamental parameters that would be interesting (and straightforward) to add? It seems like just because we have \gaia\ parallaxes we should go ahead and do it? Maybe also to do a full-circle comparison with our test sample labels.

Another open question is about the [Fe/H] validation, and whether we are happy with just the cmd plot of metallicity. I think our ideas for other tests were:
\begin{itemize}
\item Looking at M+M binary pairs: there are 174 pairs and it looks by eye that most of the pair lines are parallel to the main sequence. I don't know if there's some more clever way to see if the pairs lie in the same metallicity space of the cmd, so this is probably not that useful
\item Overplotting some isochrones at varying metallicities--which I'm still working on
\end{itemize}

Also I still have to make the vertical action plot.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Very low mass stars are the most abundant type of star, comprising $\sim 70 \%$ of the galaxy's population by number \citep{Bochanski:2010} and are known to have lifespans longer than the age of the universe (billions or up to trillions of years) \citep{Laughlin:1997} making them an interesting probe of local Milky way structure \citep{Bochanski:2007}. Relevance to exoplanet studies, and other reasons for scientific interest...

Advances in instrumentation and the lauch of several large scale spectroscopic stellar surveys launched in the past decade have dramatically increased the sample of known M dwarfs, including the \citealt{West:2011} catalog of 70,841 sources from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7; \citealt{Abazajian:2009}), and the \citealt{Yi:2014} and \citealt{Guo:2015} catalogs of 93,619 from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST DR1; \citealt{Zhao:2012}), which each have determined spectral subtype classifications, H$\alpha$ equivalent width, and a number of molecular band index measurements. Citations to any other large M dwarf catalogs that have 

The launch of the (\apogee; \citealt{Majewski:2015}) survey as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III mission \citealt{Eisenstein:2011} has introduced the largest sample of M dwarfs observed with high resolution spectroscopy. \color{gcolor}{What about \apogee\'s wavelength coverage, resolution, selection and other specs allow us to do things with M dwarfs that other surveys/instruments can't? What }\color{black}

Define what parameters/classifications are important for M dwarfs.

State why fundamental physical parameters are dificult to measure for M dwarfs. When temperatures and metallicities for a star are unavailable, it is often useful to classify a star in terms of spectral type. Define spectral type (this is a classification that is based on how a spectra looks, something to do with TiO band strengths, and it correlates with the temperature of a star).

A number of M dwarf studies have already been conducted in \apogee, particularly towards measuring reliable fundamental atmospheric parameters and kinematic measurements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citealt{Schmidt:2016} -- analyzed trends and reliablility of ASPCAP parameters for K/M dwarfs
\item \citealt{Souto:2017} and \citealt{Souto:2018} -- modeled three exoplanet hosting M dwarfs (Kepler-138, Kepler-168 and Ross-128), determining Teff/logg/metallicity + 13 elemental abundances
\item \citealt{Desphande:2013} -- modeled rotational and radial velocities for 200+ M dwarfs, later extended by \citealt{Gilhool:2018} to 700+ M dwarfs
\item \citealt{Rajpurohit:2018} -- tested BTSettl model grids on 45 M dwarfs, estimated Teff/logg/metallicity)
\item \citealt{Skinner:2018} - identified and measured mass ratios and radial velocities for 44 M dwarf binaries
\end{enumerate}


Why is there a problem labeling M dwarfs (and especially for high res \apogee\ spectra)? Emphasize issues: (1) models dont accurately reproduce data; (2) empirical standards are relative not absolute, and they are sparesely sampled. Several approaches to to determining physical parameters and the limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item model the spectra using atmospheric models (BTSettl, \citealt{Allard:2011}; PHOENIX, \citealt{Husser:2013}, MARCS \citealt{Gustafsson:2008}, ATLAS \citealt{Castelli:2004}, etc.) find some places in literature where people have tried these on M dwarfs (\citealt{Rajpurohit:2014}, \citealt{Rajpurohit:2018}) - however missing opacities, and complexities due to molecules/clouds/chemistry make this difficult (\citealt{Allard:2013})--models don't accurately reproduce spectra plus unquantified systematic errors; 

\item model narrow wavelegth region where models are good, look at specific features -- however we want to leverage the full wavelength range and resolution of our data.

\item using empirical classifications/templates/standards - SPT, luminosity class - this is a relative system but does not provide an absolute standard for measuring physical parameters
\end{enumerate}

In this work we build a data-driven model for M dwarf spectra with \thecannon\ (\citealt{Ness:2015}, \citealt{Ho:2017a}, \citealt{Casey:2016}).
\thecannon\ is a regression (typically quadratic) for the spectral pixels given a training
set of stars with reliable or accurate or assumed-accurate labels.
The model predicts spectrum given labels, but it can be turned around and also
used to predict labels given spectrum.
Thus it is a generative model for stellar spectra that can be used for parameter inference.

The data-driven approach of \thecannon\ makes sense in various contexts:
One is the context in which stellar labels are only known for a small number of stars
but there are spectra taken for many more.
Another is the context in which it is very expensive to obtain labels for a star, but
there are many stars that need labels.
Another is the context in which there are spectral models that work in one wavelength
range or resolution but not in another.
The context of this paper is the latter:
There are working and reliable models of M dwarf stars in the optical, which have been
used successfully, but (as we note above) there isn't as much success with such modeling in the infrared,
and not at \apogee\ resolution.
\color{gcolor}{HOGG: I think we can make a more specific set of points here that would be more interesting to M dwarf people: temperatures and (especially) metallicities are difficult to measure accurately for an M dwarf, but people have done a lot of work to build calibrated empirical relations for metallicities and temperatures that are very precise. 
For example \citealt{Terrien:2012}, \citealt{RojasAyala:2010}, Mann 2013 (and there's probably some other examples (Newton, etc.) and I have more literature to look at...) have a metallicity callibration based off of an FGK+M star samples, from J, H, K or optical band spectra using the equivalent width of some strong line/index (like CaI, KI, etc). However these metallicity callibrations are inaccesible for APOGEE spectra, because the wavelength coverage does not include the relevant callibration indices. \thecannon\ bridges this gap: it doesn't require using specific lines (which would probably be a mess to deconvolve at high resolution with other blends even if we had the right lines); it allows us to use a lot of low level metallicity information present in thousands of lines; and (as we demonstrate) it does so with very good precision.}\color{black}

Here we take M-dwarf labels from samples of optically observed stars that overlap the
\sdssiv\ \apogee\ sample, and use those labels to train a model and label all of the
\sdssiv\ \apogee\ M dwarfs.
One set of labels are physical parameters (effective temperatures and metallicities)
and the other set of labels are spectral types.
In each case, \thecannon\ produces a predictive model for \apogee\ spectra, but without
any input of stellar physics beyond whatever went in to producing the labels in the first
place, which was in the context of optical spectroscopy.
That is, the model to be applied to the \apogee\ data is learned from the \apogee\ data alone
This obviates physical models in the infrared, and capitalizes on the excellent data quality
delivered by the \apogee\ spectrograph and project.

%%==========================================================================================
\section{Data} \label{sec:data}

\subsection{\apogee\ Survey}

The \apogee\ survey \citep{Majewski:2015} of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III and IV (\textsl{SDSS-III/IV} \citealt{Eisenstein:2011}; \citealt{Blanton:2017}) is a high resolution (R$\sim$22,500), H-band (1.5-1.7$\mu$m), multi-epoch survey which has observed over 250,000 stellar spectra since its fourteenth data release (DR14; \citealt{Abolfathi:2017}). Fundamental parameters for each of these stars are estimated by the \apogee\ Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (\aspcap; \citealt{Perez:2016}), which employs a $\chi^2$ fitting procedure using the \textsl{FERRE} code to fit radiative transfer models and determine atmospheric parameters, 15 chemical abundances and micro-turbulence parameters (\teff, log g, [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/M], [C/M], [N/M]; \citealt{Meszaros:2012}). For low temperatures (\teff\ $<3500$K), the pipeline uses \textsl{MARCS} plane-parallel/spherical models \citep{Gustafsson:2008}, and for higher temperatures (\teff\ $\geq3500$K) \textsl{ATLAS9} \citep{Castelli:2004} plane-parallel models are used.

\apogee\ is primarily targeted for bright stellar populations, with de-reddened photometry and color cutoffs of $7 \leq H \leq 13.8$ and $[J-K]_0 \geq 0.5$ \citep{Zasowski:2013} with the objective of studying galactic composition and evolution. However numerous cool, main sequence sources have also been observed either as targets proposed by the M dwarf ancilliary survey (1,350 sources selected by proper motions from the  \citealt{Desphande:2013}), or randomly by \apogee\, which we quantify in this study to be over 10,000 in total.

The \aspcap\ pipeline releases several types of data files, with various levels of processing: {\tt\string ap1D} (the raw one-dimensional spectra for individual visits), {\tt\string apVisit} (the individual visit spectra with telluric subtraction), {\tt\string apStar} (the co-added {\tt\string apVisit} spectra), and most processed {\tt\string aspcapStar} spectra. For this work we use {\tt\string aspcapStar} files, which contains the continuum-normalized, rest frame shifted, co-added spectrum of all observed epochs (see \citealt{Perez:2016} for a complete description of the pipeline). \color{gcolor}{HOGG: do you want to comment on continuum normalization issues?}\color{black}
 
\subsection{Training Sample Selection}

\thecannon\ is a \emph{generative model} which parameterizes the flux at each pixel of a spectrum in terms of a set of stellar labels (a flexible number of parameters chosen by the user; described in more detail in Section \ref{sec:cannon}). The model in this sense is used to \emph{transfer} labels from spectra which we know parameters for to those which we do not. Hence this data-driven approach effectively removes the challenges of physically modeling the atmosphere of a star (and common issues associated such as incomplete line lists or opacities), provided that we have a subset of spectra in the dataset with known (ideally very accurately measured) \emph{reference labels} that can be measured from other surveys/methods that are easier or more accurate to infer from. 

\thecannon\ model can in principle be trained on any physical or empirical labels available, giving a wide range of flexibility to the model, however choosing a training sample with high quality (accurate and precise) is critical to the performance of \thecannon. Limitations to consider are that test labels from \thecannon\ are only accurate if the training labels accurate, and only precise if the training labels are measured using a consistent method. Also choosing a sample with large dynamic range spanning the entire parameter space of interest is important, as \thecannon\ does not extrapolate well outside the parameter space of the training sample.
\color{gcolor}{HOGG: More notes to add here?}\color{black}

For the purpose of this study we have constructed two different training samples: first a one-dimensional \emph{spectral type model}, and second a two-dimensional \emph{physical parameter model} which describes the temperature and metallicity. The choice of training labels, dimensionality of our data set, and requirements for a good training set we discuss further in Section \ref{sec:discussion}.

The spectral type sample consists of 51 sources, spanning M0-M9 cross-matched from the \citealt{West:2011} (hereafter W11) catalog of 78,841 M dwarfs from \sdss. For each source in the catalog, spectral types were determined both through an automated routine using \textsl{The Hammer} \citep{Covey:2007} and by visual inspection to a reported accuracy of $\pm$1 type.

The physical parameter sample consists of 87 sources with reference labels distributed over $2859 <T_{\rm eff} < 4131$K, and $-0.48 <$ [Fe/H] $< 0.49$, 41 sources of which are drawn from \citealt{Mann:2015} (hereafter M15), and 46 of which are part of an previously unpublished extension sample to M15 analyzed using similar data and identical techniques to M15. The major difference between the extension sample is that the sample had lower-quality or no parallaxes (prior to Gaia data) and hence were omitted from the M15 study and were less vetted for binarity than the M15 sample.

The M15 catalog in total contains 183 sources and the extension sample another 500 stars, both primarily selected from the proper-motion selected CONCH-SHELL \citep{Gaidos:2013} M dwarf catalog. All targets have low-res optical spectra from the SNIFS specgrograph \citep{Lantz:2004} and infrared spectra taken with the SpeX Spectograph \citep{Rayner:2003}, which have been combined to estaimte largely empirical bolometric fluxes. Effective temperatures have been estimated by comparing the SNIFS spectra to BT-SETTL atmospheric models \citep{Allard:2011}. A subsample of 29 sources with measured angular diameters from long-baseline optical interferometry \citep{Boyajian:2012} are used to calibrate the model comparison, including masking of spectral regions poorly reproduced by the model spectra \citep{Mann:2013c}. Based on difference between assigned \teff\ values and those from angular diameters, absolute uncertainty on \teff\ is esitmated to be 60K in \teff, although the relative uncertainty is likely a factor of $\simeq$2 better.
%AWM: I realized I've never actaully sat down and rigorously measured the relative Teff uncertainty. The results from the Cannon actually suggest ~30 is not bad. I just did some quick tests, and I'm not prepared to put an absolute number on it. A \simeq 30 here should be safeish.

Iron abundances ([Fe/H]) are assignied to the physical parameter sample based on the strenngth of metal-sensitive lines in the near-infrared SpeX spectra \citep{RojasAyala:2010} using the calibration from \citet{Mann:2013a}. The relation between these lines and an absolute [Fe/H] scale is calibrated using wide binaries containing and F, G, or K-type primary and an M dwarf companion, under the assumption that binaries formed from the same molecular cloud and therefore have the same metallicity \citep{Bonfils:2005}. Uncertainties are estimated to be $\simeq$0.08\,dex based on irreducable scatter in the empirical relation between selected lines and the assigned [Fe/H] from the primary star. As with \teff\ relative errors on [Fe/H] are smaller, estimated to be 0.04-0.06\,dex over most of the temperature and metallicity range considered here.

Spectral types reported by M15 for the sources using optical molecular band indices (by the method of \citealt{Lepine:2013}) and ranged K7.3--M4.9 for the subsample we used, although these labels were not included in the model training.

We note that surface gravity is not inclided as a training label. The reason for this is that for main-sequence M dwarfs, the parameter is almost entirely redundant with metallicity. Unlike their higher-mass counterparts, M dwarf properties do not change measurably over the age of the Universe. Hence perfect knowledge of abundances and \teff\ for an M dwarf should uniquely determine its position its surface gravity, position on a color-magnitude diagram, and overall luminosity. While we only had [Fe/H] for the training sample, for the uncertainties considered here, lack of information about [$\alpha$/Fe] or specific abundances will only be important for extreme cases (e.g., Carbon stars). 

%%AWM: Feel free to edit this for clarity. Let me know if anything makes no sense. 

%We note that rotational velocity (vsini) is not a parameter are not included as training labels because that would be hard... also it's probably not needed... I'll let someone else write that. -AWM

%%==========================================================================================
\section{Method}\label{sec:cannon}

\thecannon\ is a fully empirical model, which employs no use of line lists or radiative transfer models. Instead, \thecannon\ is a regression model which relies on two assumptions: first that sources with identical labels have near-identical flux at each pixel, and second that the expected flux at each pixel varies continuosly with change in label. 

Inferring the label of a star with such a model requires two steps: first the \emph{training step} in which a generative model describing the probability density function (pdf) of the flux is constructed at each pixel from the set of spectrum with known reference labels, and second the \emph{test step} in which the model is applied to determine the labels of a spectrum.

Following from the procedure of \citealt{Ness:2015} and \citealt{Ho:2017a} we adopt a simple linear model that assumes the flux at each pixel of the spectrum can be parameterized as a function of a label vector $\ell$ and and coefficient vector \emph{$\theta$}. So for each star \emph{n}, at wavelength pixel \emph{$\lambda$}, we state that the measured flux for a star at a given pixel is the sum of the coefficient and label product, and observational noise:
\begin{equation}
	f_{n\lambda} = \theta_{\lambda}^{T} \cdot \ell_{n} + {\rm noise} \label{eqn:cannon}
\end{equation} 
We use the noise model is ${\rm noise}=[s_{\lambda}^2 + \sigma_{n\lambda}^2]\xi_{n\lambda}$, where the bracketed term is the root mean sum of the intrinsic scatter of the model at each pixel \emph{$s_{\lambda}$}, and the uncertainty due to instrumental effects \emph{$\sigma_{n\lambda}$}, which is then multiplied times a Gaussian random number $\xi_{n\lambda} \sim \mathcal{N} (0,1)$. Equation \ref{eqn:cannon} corresponds to the single-pixel log-likelihood function:
\begin{equation}
	\ln p(f_{n\lambda}|\theta^T_{\lambda}, \ell_n, s^2_n) = 
	-\frac{1}{2}\frac{[f_{n\lambda} - \theta_{\lambda}^{T} \cdot \ell_{n}]^2}{s_{\lambda}^2 + \sigma_{n\lambda}^2} - \frac{1}{2} \ln(s_{\lambda}^2 + \sigma_{n\lambda}^2) 
	\label{eqn:likelihood}
\end{equation}
the probability density function of the measured flux, given the labels, coefficients and scatters.

We apply a quadratic parameterization of the model such that the label vectors for the two models are all of the combinations of reference labels, up to second order:
\begin{eqnarray}
\ell_{n} &=& [1, \, SPT, \, SPT^{2}] \label{eqn:spt}
\\
\ell_{n} &=& [1, \, T_{\rm eff}, \, [Fe/H], \, T_{\rm eff}^2, \, T_{\rm eff} \cdot [Fe/H], \, [Fe/H]^{2}] \label{eqn:physical}
,
\end{eqnarray}
Equation (\ref{eqn:spt}) is the label vector for the spectral type model, and equation (\ref{eqn:physical}) is the label vector for the physical parameter model, and the first element ``1'' is included to allow flexibility for a linear offset to the model. We find that a second order parameterization is sufficient for reproducing the flux of each spectrum to one percent accuracy, as discussed further in Section \ref{subsec:mann_results}.

The \emph{training step} consists of optimizing the likelihood function (Equation \ref{eqn:likelihood}) for the coefficient vector and scatter ($\theta_{\lambda}$ and $s_{\lambda}$) given fixed label vector (\emph{$\ell_n$}) constructed from the reference labels, and the \emph{test step} consists of optimizing the likelihood function for the labels at fixed $\theta_{\lambda}$ and $s_{\lambda}$ obtained in the training step (see \citealt{Ness:2015} for further description). 
Thus \thecannon\ is both a generative model for the stellar spectra, and a method for obtaining 
labels from spectra. In the training step, the regression is designed to predict spectral pixels
given labels, by learning zeroth, first, and second derivatives of the data with respect to
the labels. In the test step, the regression is designed to predict labels given the spectral
derivatives.

%%==========================================================================================
\section{Experiments and Results} \label{sec:results}

\subsection{Temperature/Metallicity Model \label{subsec:mann_results}}
For the physical parameter model we trained \thecannon\ on 87 M dwarfs with a two-dimensional temperature/metallicity labels, to a precision of 77K/0.09dex as estimated by the cross validation scatter, similar to the original training sample uncertainties of 60K/0.08dex. We note for this model 6 out of 87 sources show strong visible rotational line broadening (as indicated by the red circles in Figure~\ref{fig:mann_validation}), while the remaining sources are mostly old ($>8$ Gyr) and likely slowly rotating sources. While these sources with high rotational broadening have high $\chi^2$ values (those sources with $\chi^2 > 80,000$ in Figure \ref{fig:chi_dist}), we find that the scatter of labels derived for these sources is consistent with the rest of the sample and we do not remove them from the training sample.

Two tests of consistency were used to assess the validity of our model's labels: (1) the self-test comparing training label to test label values, and (2) the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) test, in which we train a model on all sources but \emph{n}, then apply the \emph{N-1} source trained model to obtain the labels for star \emph{n}. Precision (scatter) and bias of the model for each test are calculated as the standard deviation and mean of the difference in training and test (or LOOCV) labels respectively (Figure \ref{fig:mann_validation}). Since the LOOCV test evaluates both how well the model reproduces the training values \emph{and} penalizes the model for over-fitting, we adopt the LOOCV scatter over the self-test scatter as the more conservative estimate of the model's precision. The set of training, test, and LOOCV labels for each training source is reported in Table \ref{table:mann_results}.

Another mode of analysis we can look at with \thecannon\ is how the derivative of the model changes with respect to given training parameters, which makes our model interpretable for discovering or verifying atomic or molecular lines with strong dependence on different physical parameters. The top two panels of Figures \ref{fig:demo_teff} and \ref{fig:demo_feh} show two example spectra and model fits for two different temperatures (\ref{fig:demo_teff}), and two different temperatures (\ref{fig:demo_feh}), with atomic and molecular features identified by the abundance analysis of \citealt{Souto:2017}. The bottom panels of Figures \ref{fig:demo_teff} and \ref{fig:demo_feh} show the derivative of flux with respect to temperature and metallicity at each pixel, taken at the median training values. In order to evaluate which spectral features show statistically significant change with respect to input label, we compute error of the derivative at each pixel using a jackknife statistic (with a 1-$\sigma$ level overplotted in red):
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{\theta,m}^2 = \frac{N-1}{N} \sum^N_{n=1} (\theta_{/n}^m - \theta^m)^2 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Spectral Type Model \label{subsec:west_results}}
We trained \thecannon\ on 51 M dwarfs with a one-dimensional spectral type label, and obtained a precision of $\pm$0.9 spectral types, also similar to the original training label uncertainty of $\pm$1 spectral type. We note however, that the training sample is distributed heavily towards earlier type sources, with a median spectral type of 3 and only one M8 and one M9 source. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:west_validation}, the model performs well at re-deriving the labels for the M8 and M9 source when they are included in the model (less than 1 SPT difference), but badly when left out (over 2 SPT difference), which indicates \thecannon\ does a poor job at extrapolating to labels outside of the training sample space. Repeating the analysis of Section \ref{subsec:mann_results}, Figure \ref{fig:west_validation} shows the self and LOOCV tests for the labels reported in Table \ref{table:west_results}, and Figure \ref{fig:west_derivative} shows the derivative of model flux with varying spectral type.

\subsection{Test Sample \label{subsec:test_selection}} 
Out of the total \apogee\ DR14 catalog of 258,475 sources, we selected 254,478 sources which were in the cross match of \textsl{Gaia DR2} (\citealt{Brown:2018}) and applied \gaia\ color-magnitude cuts of $1<BP-RP<6$ and $7.5<M_G<20$ for sources with only positive parallaxes ($\varpi>0$), yielding a sample of 14,827 sources. From there we applied the following selection procedure to identify a sample of single, main-sequence M stars. Although our catalog reports the temperatures, metallicities, and spectral types for 10,311 sources out of 14,827 with $\chi^2<100,000$, the sources we deem ``safe'', with minimal contamination from reddened K dwarfs, pre-main sequence stars, and binaries, are selected by the following criteria (see Figure \ref{fig:cmd_selection}):

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Known contaminant cut:} We remove known pre-main sequence sources from \citealt{Cottaar:2014} (280 sources), and known binaries from \citealt{ElBadry:2018} and \citealt{Skinner:2018} (58 sources).

\item \textbf{K dwarf cut:} In \zmass\ photometry we select $M_K > 4.3$ to remove likely K dwarfs, which appear reddened in \gaia\ $BP$, $RP$ photometry.

\item \textbf{Pre-main sequence, multiple system and subdwarf cut:} in \gaia\ and \zmass\ we apply $.7<J-K<1.1$ and points in the selction region within the points $\left\{ (1.4, 7.5), (2.2, 7.5), (4.2, 14), (3.3, 14) \right\}$ of ($BP-RP$, $M_G$) to cut remaining likely pre-main sequence, multiple sources above the main sequence and subdwarfs below the main sequence.

\item \textbf{Quality of fit cut:} We apply a $\chi^2$ cut of less than 100,000.

\item \textbf{Training bound selection:} Because extrapolation with \thecannon\ is unreliable, we select only sources with labels inside the range of the training sample: for the reported temperatures and metallicities we impose $2850<T_{\rm eff}<4150$ and $-0.5<$[Fe/H]$<0.5$, and for reported spectral subtypes we impose $0<SPT<9$.
\end{enumerate}

The three panels of \ref{fig:safe_selection} show before and after selection of the sources in \gaia\ color-magnitude space, colored by \thecannon\ determined temperatures, metallicities, and spectral types, with their respective training samples overplotted in orange. Each plot shows the expected gradient: temperature increases with decreasing color, spectral subtype increases with increasing color, and metallicity gradient increases perpendicularly to the main sequence branch. Additionally we notice a slight deviation at the upper slice of the main sequence where \cannon\ temperatures, metallicities and spectral types all appear lower than the gradient trends in the rest of the branch, which is most likely the binary sequence. Comparisons between the West-trained spectral types and Mann-trained temperatures and metallicities are shown in Figure \ref{fig:west_vs_mann}: left shows the slight negative correlation between spectral type and [Fe/H], and right shows the nonlinear decrease in temperature with visible metallicity gradient. We also note that applying our model requires very little computational demand: the time to train and test a model on all 14,827 sources was two minutes on a personal laptop. 

\subsection{Validation of parameters}

In \citealt{Schmidt:2016} the authors used three different color-temperature relations to check the consistency of \aspcap\ temperature values using a combination of \zmass\ and visual band photometries. \color{gcolor}{Brief description of the color-teff relations from \citealt{Casagrande:2008}, \citealt{Boyajian:2013}, and \citealt{Mann:2015}...}\color{black}. 

To obtain visual band magnitudes for a set of sources, we cross-matched the 10,311 sources in our ``safe'' test sample to the AAVSO Photometric All-Sky Survey DR9 (APASS; \citealt{Henden:2016}), to obtain a subsample of 6,000 sources with both $BV$ photometries measured by APASS, and $JHK$ photometries from \apogee. In Figure \ref{fig:aspcap_cannon_validation} we repeat the temperature validation tests for each of the three relations and compare the \aspcap\ temperatures for the same sources. \color{gcolor}{Comments about validation results and the uncertainty of our Cannon temperatures...}\color{black}

\color{gcolor}{What are all of the parameters we want to report and what do we want to emphasize? Are there other parameters (such as mass) that might be straightforward to estimate?}\color{black}

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[-] Brief summary of what we did and found

\item[-] Is it interesting to point out the comoving pairs we found? (33 FGK-M, 13 WD-M, and 174 M-M pairs)?

\item[-] Things we learned along the way: For example, not all training sets worked well in our experiments, probably because they were too small or had too little dynamic range.

\item[-] \color{gcolor}{HOGG: Some discussion of precision and accuracy: \thecannon\ can produce precise results, but is only as accurate as its training set.}\color{black}

\item[-] Some discussion of whether the derivatives are sensible or surprising. 

\item[-] \thecannon\ as a test of evaluating training parameter accuracy?

\item[-] Discussion of validation tests and ground truth

\item[-] HOGG: Discussion of the implications of these results for the NASA \tess\ Mission and how the future might change..?

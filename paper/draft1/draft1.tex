\begin{abstract}

The Cannon \citep{Ness:2015} is a flexible, data-driven spectral modeling and parameter inference framework, demonstrated on high-resolution Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE; $\lambda/\Delta\lambda\sim22,500$, $1.5-1.7 \mu m$) spectra of giant stars to estimate stellar labels (T$_{\rm eff}$, logg, [Fe/H], and chemical abundances) to precisions higher than the model-grid pipeline. The lack of reliable stellar parameters reported by the APOGEE pipeline for temperatures less than $\sim3550K$ \citep{Schmidt:2016}, motivates the extension of this approach to M dwarf stars. Using a training set of 51 M dwarfs with spectral types ranging M0-M9 obtained from SDSS optical spectra, we demonstrate that The Cannon can infer spectral types to a precision of 0.6 types. We then use 30 M dwarfs ranging $3072 < T_{\rm eff} < 4131K$, and -0.48 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ 0.49 to train a two-parameter model precise to 44K and 0.05 dex respectively. Additionally we discuss the extension of a model to other labels, and the scientific objectives a data-driven pipeline could enable.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item[-] Why M-dwarfs are important: most abundant type of star, are planet hosts (The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs \citealt{Trifonov:2018}; some famous examples: Trappist 1 (M8) -- \citealt{Gillon:2017}; Kepler-186, Kepler-138... other examples?), have lifespans longer than the age of the universe (billions or up to trillions of years) \citep{Laughlin:1997} making them an interesting probe of Milky way populations \citep{Bochanski:2007}.
% \end{enumerate}
Very low mass (VLM) are the most abundant type of star, comprising $\sim 70 \%$ of the galaxy's population by number \citep{Bochanski:2010} and $\sim 40 \%$ by mass 
 are known to have lifespans longer than the age of the universe (billions or up to trillions of years) \citep{Laughlin:1997} making them an interesting probe of Milky way populations \citep{Bochanski:2007}.

\subsection{M dwarf Challenge}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[-] Various attempts / samples for which people have tried to make substantial catalogs of M-dwarfs with physical labels on them (\citealt{West:2011} is the largest M dwarf catalog of $\sim$ 70k sources; \citealt{Deacon:2014} -- \color{red}{Need citations!}\color{black}) 

\item[-] Why is there a problem labeling M dwarfs? Generally, two kinds of approaches to labeling:

 (1) model the spectra using atmospheric models (BTSettl, \citealt{Allard:2011}; PHOENIX, \citealt{Husser:2013}, MARCS \citealt{Gustafsson:2008}, ATLAS \citealt{Castelli:2004}, etc.) find some places in literature where people have tried these on M dwarfs (\color{red}{Need citations... }\color{black} look at Burgasser, Blake...) - however missing opacities, and complexities due to molecules/clouds/chemistry make this difficult (\color{red}{Need citations... }\color{black} \citealt{Allard:2013}); 

 (2) model narrow wavelegth region where models are good, look at specific features (\citealt{Rojas-Ayala:2012}...), or reduce resolution (\citealt{Casagrande:2008} estimated effective temperatures, bolometric luminosities, and metallicities using optical and infrared photometries) -- however we want to use \emph{all} of the data!

% \item[-] The idea in general of The Cannon, and the fact that it could be used to amplify a small number of labeled M-dwarfs in a training set into a huge number of labeled M-dwarfs, provided that there are overlapping objects. Make the point that The Cannon does not require us to have good M-dwarf models in the APOGEE wavelength range at all!

\item[-] Why The Cannon approach? Can be used to amplify a small number of labeled M-dwarfs in a training set into a huge number of labeled M-dwarfs, provided that there are overlapping objects; Make the point that The Cannon does not require us to have good M-dwarf models in the APOGEE wavelength range at all!

\item[-] Describe M dwarf studies that have already been conducted in APOGEE (\citealt{Schmidt:2016} -- analyzed trends and reliablility of ASPCAP parameters for K/M dwarfs; \citealt{Souto:2017} -- modeled 2 M dwarfs, determined Teff/logg/metallicity + 13 elemental abundances; \citealt{Desphande:2013} -- modeled rotational and radial velocites for several hundred M dwarfs; \citealt{Rajpurohit:2018} -- tested BTSettl model grids on 45 M dwarfs, estimated Teff/logg/metallicity)

\end{enumerate}

\section{Data} \label{sec:data}

\subsection{APOGEE Survey}
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item[-] Describe the APOGEE data (survey mission: \citealt{Majewski:2015}; target selection: \citealt{Zasowski:2013}; ASPCAP pipeline: \citealt{Perez:2016}). 

% \item[-] Some M dwarfs in APOGEE proposed as ancilliary targets (Blake/Covey sources), plus an unknown number observed unintentionally \citep{Desphande:2013}.
% \end{enumerate}

The APOGEE survey \citep{Majewski:2015} of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) is a high resolution (R$\sim$22,500), H-band (1.5-1.7$\mu$m) survey which has observed over 260,000 stellar spectra since its fourteenth data release (DR14; \citealt{Abolfathi:2017}). While APOGEE is primarily targeted for bright stellar populations (descirbe cuts \citealt{Zasowski:2013}) with the objective of studying galactic composition and evolution, numerous cool, main sequence have also been observed either as targets proposed by the M dwarf ancilliary survey \citep{Desphande:2013}

Fundamental parameters for each of these stars (including temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and 15 chemical abundances) are estimated by the APOGEE Stellar Parameter
and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP; \citealt{Perez:2016})

\subsection{Training Samples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[-] Describe the spectral-type training data \citep{West:2011}. One paragraph plus citations. Include any cuts we apply. \color{red}{Make diagnostic plots.}\color{black}

\item[-] Describe the Teff, Fe/H training data \citep{Mann:2015}. Same; Include any cuts. \color{red}{Make diagnostic plots.}\color{black}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods} \label{sec:cannon}

\subsection{The Cannon: A Data-Driven Approach}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[-] A few-paragraph summary of what The Cannon does, with references (\citealt{Ness:2015}, \citealt{Casey:2016}, \citealt{Ho:2017a}, \citealt{Ho:2017b})
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data-Driven Model}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[-] Describe assumptions of the model: (1) Sources with identical labels have near-identical flux at each pixel; (2) Expected flux at each pixel varies continuosly with change in label. 
\item[-] Briefly describe modeling procedure (training step, test step, quadratic labels, etc.), refer to \citealt{Ness:2015} for full description.
\item[-] Briefly describe model inputs and outputs (1D spectral type model and 2D teff/metallicity and label vectors for those). Mention other models we've tested.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experimental Results} \label{sec:results}

\subsection{Spectral Type Model}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[-] We trained The Cannon on 51 M dwarfs with a one-dimensional spectral type label, and was able to achieve a precision of $\pm$0.8 spectral types, more precise than the original training label uncertainty of $\pm$1 spectral type.
\item[-] Two tests of consistency were used to assess the validity of our derived test labels: Figure \ref{fig:west_selftest} displays the label self-test for the spectral type model, and Figure 2 displays 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[-] Brief summary of what we did and found

\item[-] Things we learned along the way: For example, not all training sets worked well in our experiments, probably because they were too small or had too little dynamic range.

\item[-] Some discussion of precision and accuracy: The Cannon can produce precise results, but is only as accurate as its training set. 

\item[-] Some discussion of whether the derivatives are sensible or surprising. \color{red}{Add derivative plots.}\color{black}

\item[-] Comment on specific features? \color{red}{Can easily plot some line lists, but not sure where to go with the analysis... What features are important for M dwarfs? Compare derivative plots of specific lines between theory-trained models and data-trained models?}\color{black}

\item[-] The Cannon as a test of evaluating training parameter accuracy?

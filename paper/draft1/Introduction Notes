Introduction Notes
------------------

large multiplicity - probe milky way structure, chemical composition
long lifetimes - probe the history of the milky way
exoplanet hosts - cool brown dwarf atmospheres are used as the models for exoplanet atmospheres; in order to constrain 

Scientific overview:
How are M dwarfs used to study galactic structure (chemical composition, dynamics, etc.)?
How does the long lifetime of M dwarfs help to probe the history of the milky way?
Why are M dwarfs relevant to exoplanet studies?
	- small radii relative to solar-type stars allows for easier detection of exoplanets by transit detection
How are M dwarf atmospheres similar to exoplanet atmospheres?
How does constraining measurements of fundamental/atmospheric parameters of host M dwarfs improve the constraints on exoplanet atmospheres?

Why is it important to measure the temperature and metallicity of M dwarfs?
Why is it important to measure spectral type of M dwarfs?

Why APOGEE survey? - high resolution, multi epoch, large number of m dwarfs
	- Why do we need high resolution spectroscopy?
	- How many M dwarfs are in APOGEE?
